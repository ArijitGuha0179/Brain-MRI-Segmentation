# Brain-MRI-Segmentation

## Features
- The objective was to determine the presence of a tumor in brain MRI images and, if detected,accurately delineate the tumorâ€™s region.
- Developed a segmentation model leveraging the U-Net architecture with a ResNet 50 backbone.
- Implemented a streamlined pipeline that initially classifies images for the presence of tumours and, when identified, proceeds to perform precise image
  segmentation for cancer localisation.
